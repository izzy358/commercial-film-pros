                <h1>Commercial Security Window Film for Bay Area Businesses</h1>
                <p class="subtitle">From the threat of "smash and grab" incidents in urban centers like San Francisco and Oakland, to the ever-present concern of seismic activity, Bay Area businesses require robust, proactive security measures. Commercial Film Pros offers advanced commercial security window film solutions designed to fortify your glass, deter intruders, and mitigate hazards from unexpected impacts and natural disasters.</p>

                <h2>Why Commercial Security Window Film is Essential</h2>
                <h3>Deterring Forced Entry & Vandalism</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our security films hold shattered glass firmly in place, turning a quick "smash and grab" into a noisy, time-consuming, and highly visible endeavor. Most burglars abandon attempts within seconds if they encounter unexpected resistance.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Smash and Grab" Protection:</strong> Significantly slows down opportunistic thieves</li>
                    <li><strong>Anti-Graffiti Film:</strong> Sacrificial, easily replaceable layer protects glass from etching, scratching, and spray paint</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Glass Hazard Mitigation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Holds shattered glass intact during impacts, explosions, or earthquakes</li>
                    <li>Meets safety glazing codes (CPSC 16 CFR 1201) for schools, healthcare, and high-traffic spaces</li>
                    <li>Earthquake protection — prevents large glass sections from detaching during tremors</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Blast & Impact Protection</h3>
                <p>Thicker, multi-layered films absorb shockwaves and hold glass in place during explosions. Solutions available that meet GSA standards for government facilities.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Types of Security Window Films</h2>
                <h3>Clear Security & Safety Films</h3>
                <p>Virtually invisible once installed. Enhance glass strength and hold shattered glass together. Available in 4 mil to 14 mil thickness.</p>
                <h3>Tinted Security Films</h3>
                <p>Combine security protection with solar control — heat rejection, UV protection, glare reduction, and daytime privacy.</p>
                <h3>Anti-Graffiti Films</h3>
                <p>Sacrificial barrier for exterior glass. Easily and cost-effectively removed and replaced when defaced, leaving underlying glass pristine.</p>
